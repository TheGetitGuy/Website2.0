TheGetItGuy V2.0
===================
This is my Website 2.0, A React.js new and updated version of thegetitguy.com!
---------------------
* A Reactive site that displays my many talents!
* A Dev Page | Main Page?
* Sprite Page
* Art Page
* Socials Page 

<br>

These Different Pages will be fed through data, either in their JSX or maybe through different JSON files?

This will Help to better maintain the site.

Feed the navigation bars, Maybe get icons?

For the Content of the different Pages

1. A title or description for the Item
2. An Image
3. More description for underneath

   * maybe make different looking frames or backgrounds
